# Media Content Analyzer

The project is a media analyzer, using documentation-first, test-driven, agent-supervised development.

## Project Overview

For a detailed description of the application, its architecture, features, and development standards, see the [Project Overview](PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md) and [Architecture Documentation](docs/architecture.md).

Key principles used for developing this project:
- **Documentation-first:** All requirements, design docs, and test plans are created and validated before coding begins.
- **Test-driven development:** Tests are written before or alongside code, ensuring correctness and rapid feedback.
- **Agent supervision:** Developers guide, review, and validate AI-generated outputs.
- **Continuous improvement:** Feedback loops and clear documentation support onboarding, compliance, and quality.
