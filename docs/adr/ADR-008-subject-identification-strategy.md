# ADR 008: Subject Identification Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context
For FR-002-audio-subject-identification, we need a reliable method to identify subjects and topics from transcribed audio text. The solution needs to:
- Process text within 500ms for up to 10,000 words
- Achieve 90% accuracy in subject identification
- Support multiple subjects per text
- Handle various content types and lengths
- Maintain low resource usage (< 500MB memory, < 50% CPU)

## Decision
Implement a hybrid subject identification approach combining:

1. **Topic Modeling with LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)**
   - Used for discovering abstract topics
   - Identifies broader themes and categories
   - Implemented using `gensim` library

2. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**
   - Identifies specific entities (people, organizations, locations)
   - Provides concrete subjects
   - Implemented using `spacy` library

3. **Keyword Extraction**
   - Uses RAKE (Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction) algorithm
   - Supplements topic and entity identification
   - Handles domain-specific terminology

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Processing Pipeline
1. Text Preprocessing
   - Tokenization and normalization
   - Stop word removal
   - Lemmatization

2. Parallel Processing
   - Run LDA, NER, and keyword extraction concurrently
   - Combine results using weighted scoring

3. Subject Ranking and Categorization
   - Score subjects based on frequency and context
   - Group related subjects using hierarchical clustering
   - Apply confidence scoring based on multiple factors

#### Libraries and Dependencies
- `gensim`: Topic modeling
- `spacy`: NER and linguistic processing
- `sklearn`: TF-IDF and ML utilities
- `networkx`: Subject relationship graphs

## Consequences

### Positive
- Comprehensive subject identification through multiple methods
- High accuracy through combined approaches
- Scalable to different content types
- Maintainable modular architecture
- Easy to extend with new identification methods

### Negative
- Multiple dependencies to manage
- Need to tune parameters for optimal performance
- Increased memory usage from multiple models
- Potential complexity in maintaining multiple algorithms

### Mitigations
- Use lazy loading for models
- Implement caching for frequent operations
- Configure thread pool for parallel processing
- Regular performance monitoring and optimization

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Model Management**
   ```python
   class ModelManager:
       def __init__(self):
           self._lda_model = None
           self._spacy_model = None
           self._rake = None

       def get_model(self, model_type: str) -> Any:
           # Lazy loading of models
           pass
   ```

2. **Processing Pipeline**
   ```python
   class SubjectProcessor:
       def process(self, text: str) -> List[Subject]:
           # Parallel processing of different methods
           with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
               topic_future = executor.submit(self._process_topics, text)
               ner_future = executor.submit(self._process_entities, text)
               keyword_future = executor.submit(self._process_keywords, text)
               
           return self._combine_results(
               topic_future.result(),
               ner_future.result(),
               keyword_future.result()
           )
   ```

3. **Confidence Scoring**
   ```python
   class ConfidenceScorer:
       def score(self, subject: Subject, context: Context) -> float:
           # Multiple factors in confidence calculation
           topic_score = self._calculate_topic_coherence()
           entity_score = self._calculate_entity_confidence()
           keyword_score = self._calculate_keyword_significance()
           
           return self._weighted_combine(
               topic_score,
               entity_score,
               keyword_score
           )
   ```

## Performance Considerations

- Cache frequently accessed models and results
- Use batch processing for multiple texts
- Implement early stopping for time-critical operations
- Monitor memory usage and implement cleanup

## Monitoring and Metrics

Track:
- Processing time per text
- Memory usage per model
- Accuracy of subject identification
- Cache hit rates
- Error rates and types
