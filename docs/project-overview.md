# Media Content Analyzer - Project Overview

## Vision
The Media Content Analyzer is an intelligent Python-based system designed to analyze audio and video content, with an initial focus on audio analysis. The system aims to extract meaningful information from media files, starting with text transcription and summarization from audio files, and eventually expanding to include theme extraction and visual representation generation.

## Current Scope (Phase 1)
- Audio file analysis with focus on text extraction and summarization
- Support for common audio formats (WAV, MP3, etc.)
- Specialized handling for different content types (e.g., children's stories)
- Command-line interface for processing audio files
- Robust error handling and logging
- Comprehensive test coverage with strict separation of unit tests (mocked dependencies) and integration tests (real components)
- Clear documentation and API specifications

## Future Scope
- Theme extraction from audio content
- Visual representation generation
- Video file analysis capabilities
- API for integration with other systems
- Web interface for file processing
- Batch processing capabilities

## Technical Stack
- **Language**: Python 3.x
- **Development Approach**:
  - Documentation-First Development
  - Test-Driven Development (TDD)
  - AI Agent-Assisted Development
- **Key Libraries** (Initial Planning):
  - Speech Recognition: speech_recognition, whisper
  - Audio Processing: pydub
  - Text Processing: nltk, spacy
  - Testing: pytest
  - Documentation: Sphinx

## Development Standards
- All features must have complete documentation before implementation
- **Test coverage requirement**: 90%+ unit tests (mocked), 80%+ integration tests (real components)
- **Testing strategy**: Strict separation between unit tests (fast, mocked dependencies) and integration tests (real components)
- Code review required for all changes
- Continuous Integration/Deployment pipelines
- Regular security audits
- Performance benchmarking

## Getting Started
1. Review the [Architecture Documentation](docs/architecture.md)
2. Follow the [Environment Setup Guide](environment-setup.md)
3. Read the [Coding Standards](coding-standards.md)
4. Check the [Contributing Guidelines](contributing.md)

## Development Workflow
1. Create/update feature specification in `docs/requirements/`
2. Write tests based on the specification
3. Implement the feature with AI assistance
4. Review and validate the implementation
5. Document the feature in relevant documentation
6. Submit for review
