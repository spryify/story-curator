## Alternative Libraries Considered

### Speech Recognition

1. **CMU Sphinx**
   - Pros: Fully offline, open-source
   - Cons: Lower accuracy compared to Whisper, limited language support
   - Decision: Used as fallback through SpeechRecognition interface

2. **Google Cloud Speech-to-Text**
   - Pros: High accuracy, extensive features
   - Cons: Cost, requires internet connection
   - Decision: Available as an option through SpeechRecognition interface

### Podcast Processing and RSS Analysis

**Architecture Decision**: See [ADR-010: Podcast Analysis Architecture](adr/ADR-010-podcast-analysis-architecture.md) for complete technical details.

**Key Library Choices**:
- **aiohttp (>= 3.8.0)**: Async HTTP client for RSS feed fetching
- **xml.etree.ElementTree**: Standard library XML parsing for RSS feeds
- **OpenAI Whisper**: Streaming audio transcription from podcast URLs

**Benefits**:
- Async processing prevents blocking on network requests
- Standard library XML parsing provides security and reliability
- Direct audio stream transcription avoids local file storage
- Configurable Whisper model sizes balance accuracy vs performance

### Text Processing

1. **Transformers (Hugging Face)**
   - Pros: State-of-the-art models, extensive capabilities
   - Cons: Heavy resource requirements, complexity
   - Decision: May integrate later for advanced features

2. **TextBlob**
   - Pros: Simple API, good for basic NLP
   - Cons: Limited features compared to spaCy
   - Decision: Chose spaCy for more robust capabilities

## Future Considerations

1. **Deep Learning Integration**
   - Consider adding PyTorch/TensorFlow for custom model development
   - Potential for fine-tuning Whisper models

2. **Podcast Analysis Enhancements**
   - Real-time podcast stream processing
   - Speaker identification and diarization
   - Content classification for age-appropriate filtering

3. **Scalability**
   - Monitor performance with large audio files
   - Consider adding support for distributed processing

4. **Additional Features**
   - Emotion detection in speech
   - Multiple language support enhancement
   - Advanced RSS feed caching strategies
