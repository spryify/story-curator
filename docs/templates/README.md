## How to Use These Templates

### For AI Agents

1. **Choose the Right Template**: Select based on what you're implementing
2. **Copy the Template**: Use as a starting point for your implementation
3. **Replace Placeholders**: Update class names, descriptions, and logic
4. **Follow the Patterns**: Keep the same structure and error handling
5. **Add Your Logic**: Implement the specific functionality needed
